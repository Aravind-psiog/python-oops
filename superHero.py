Explaining OOP concept in a easy way.
Points to remember:
_name(single underscore) represents Protected class
__name(double underscore) represents Private class
We will see when and how to use these.

Consider a storyline set in a universe where humans have developed
a serum that grants superpowers to individuals with specific DNA
disorders. One day, these superheroes decide to establish a headquarters
where they can monitor all crimes and stop them effectively.

So here, let us consider a hierarchy Humans > Supes > Headquaters i.e, Humans
being at top of the hierarchy

    Eg. Ironman and Captain america are humans and they have their names(properties).

    which takes args and qwargs to perform action based on their properties.
